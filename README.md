🚀 Building a Blockchain in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide 💻
By Fábio Leandro Lapuinka | August 2, 2025

🔗 Blockchain isn’t just about Bitcoin—it’s a revolutionary way to secure data!

Ever wondered how blockchains work under the hood? 🤔 Let’s break it down with a simple Python implementation using Flask. This demo covers blocks, proof-of-work, hashing, and chain validation.

🧱 Core Components of Our Blockchain
python
import hashlib
import json
import time
from flask import Flask, jsonify

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.create_block(proof=1, previous_hash='0')  # Genesis block!
1️⃣ Creating a Block
Each block stores:

📌 Index

⏰ Timestamp

🔑 Proof (from mining)

🔗 Previous block’s hash

python
def create_block(self, proof, previous_hash):
    block = {
        'index': len(self.chain) + 1,
        'proof': proof,
        'previous_hash': previous_hash,
        'timestamp': time.time()  # ⏱️
    }
    self.chain.append(block)
    return block
2️⃣ Mining (Proof-of-Work)
Miners solve a puzzle to add a block. Here, we find a number (new_proof) where its hash starts with "0000":

python
def proof_of_work(self, previous_proof):
    new_proof = 1
    while True:
        hash_op = hashlib.sha256(str(new_proof**2 - previous_proof**2).encode()).hexdigest()
        if hash_op.startswith('0000'):  # 🎯 Target difficulty
            return new_proof
        new_proof += 1
3️⃣ Hashing & Validation
🔐 Each block is hashed using SHA-256.

✔️ The chain validates integrity by checking hashes and proof compliance.

python
def is_chain_valid(self, chain):
    for i in range(1, len(chain)):
        prev_block = chain[i-1]
        curr_block = chain[i]
        if curr_block['previous_hash'] != self.hash(prev_block):
            return False  # ❌ Tampered!
        prev_proof = prev_block['proof']
        curr_proof = curr_block['proof']
        hash_op = hashlib.sha256(str(curr_proof**2 - prev_proof**2).encode()).hexdigest()
        if not hash_op.startswith('0000'):
            return False  # ❌ Invalid proof!
    return True  # ✅ Chain is valid!
💡 Why This Matters
🌍 Decentralization: No single point of control.

🔒 Immutability: Data can’t be altered retroactively.

⚖️ Consensus: Proof-of-work secures the network.
